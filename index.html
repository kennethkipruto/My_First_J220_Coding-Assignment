<h1>Kenneth Kipruto Ng'etich</h1>

<p>I am an international student from Nairobi, Kenya.I have had a lifelong love affair with the written and spoken word. As a young boy, I loved imitating radio news presenters to the great amusement of my friends. And once I learned to write, the amount of writing I did was limited only by the availability of pen and paper.</p>
  
<p>Coding scares me. But I am very ready to learn it and I am excited to be in this class.</p>
